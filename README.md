# My dotfiles

Just a few configs that I can't live without. Will probably add more in the future.

These configs purposely avoid installing anything (homebrew, oh-my-zsh, etc). For that I use Boxen, which is also
responsible for cloning/installing this repo.

# Installation

Installs script is heavily inspired in Holman's dotfiles [bootstrap](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/blob/master/script/bootstrap).

```
git clone
cd dotfiles/
bin/install.sh
```
